#  City Temperature Analysis

This project visualizes historical temperature data for three cities: **Moscow**, **Melbourne**, and **San Francisco** using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset includes monthly temperature records from 2014 onwards.

##  Dataset

The dataset (`CityTemps_1jkv0l (3).csv`) contains the following columns:
- `Year`
- `Month`
- `Moscow` (temperature in °C)
- `Melbourne` (temperature in °C)
- `San Francisco` (temperature in °C)

##  Visualizations

The notebook/script generates the following plots:

1. **Histogram of Temperatures**  
   A combined view of temperature distribution across all cities.

2. **Bar Plot - Average Temperature per City**  
   Displays the overall average temperature for each city.

3. **Line Plot - Monthly Temperature Trends**  
   Shows monthly trends for each city across the year.

4. **Boxplot - Temperature Distribution per City**  
   Highlights the spread and outliers in each city’s temperature data.

5. **Heatmap - Average Monthly Temperatures per City**  
   A color-coded matrix showing how temperatures vary month by month in each city.

##  Tools Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

##  Insights

These visualizations help in:
- Identifying seasonal patterns and trends.
- Comparing climate differences across cities.
- Observing data spread and potential outliers.
